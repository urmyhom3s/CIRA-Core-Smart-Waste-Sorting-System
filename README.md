This project was completed during GTC: CIRA Core Camp #3. I participated as a high school student and learned how to configure a simple AI model using CIRA Core. My team and I set up a node-based workflow to classify trash into different bins.

This project helped me learn the basics of training AI models and understanding how data flows through a system, even as a beginner.
